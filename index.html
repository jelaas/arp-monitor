NAME
       arp-monitor

SYNOPSIS
       arp-monitor [-hq] [-i --if IFNAME ] [-I --ifindex IFINDEX ]
                   [-t --time-out SECS ] [-c --checkcount COUNT ] [ --syslog ]

DESCRIPTION
       Default operation without any arguments is to listen for ARP packets on
       all interfaces.
       arp-monitor  keeps track of all MAC addresses seen and IP addresses are
       claimed. After a certain configurable time has passed without seeing  a
       MAC  address  it  is  removed  from  the  list  of  known addresses. IP
       addresses are also disconnected from the MAC in the same way.

       Output:
       EVENT IFINDEX IFNAME HW DATE TIME IPLIST
       HW is the MAC address.
       IPLIST is a colon separated list of IP addresses claimed by HW.

       EVENT is one of the following:
       REG = New MAC hardware seen.
       IP  = New IP for MAC seen.
       CHK = MAC not seen in timeout seconds.
       REL = MAC not seen in timeout*checkcount seconds. Removed from list.

OPTIONS
       -h --help

              Short usage text.

       -i --if IFNAME

              Optionally only listen on interface IFNAME.

       -I --ifindex IFINDEX

              Optionally only listen on IFINDEX.

       -t --timeout SECS

              Every SECS seconds a CHK event is reported if  the  HW  has  not
              been seen. Default value is 60 seconds.

       -c --checkcount COUNT

              Number of CHK events before release. Default is 10.

       -n --nocheck

              Do not report CHK events.

       -q --quiet

              Suppress output to stdout.

       --syslog

              Log  to  syslog using LOG_DAEMON.LOG_INFO. Support for syslog is
              optional at compile time.
